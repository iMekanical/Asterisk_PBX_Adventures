# Case 01: REGISTER Fails with `404 Not Found`  
## AOR 10000 | MicroSIP ‚Üí Asterisk (PJSIP) | NAT | Misnamed AOR

### üß† TL;DR

- **Client:** MicroSIP 3.21.6 behind NAT.
- **Server:** Asterisk (GIT-master) on a public IPv4.
- **Symptom:** Softphone sends REGISTER. Auth works. Server replies `404 Not Found`.
- **Cause:** Endpoint was defined, but the AOR name was mismatched or misreferenced.
- **Fix:** Unified AOR name (`10000`) across `[endpoint]`, `[auth]`, and `[aor]`.

### üìú Original PJSIP Registration Attempt


REGISTER sip:pbx.example.net SIP/2.0
Contact: <sip:10000@192.0.2.30:59759;ob>
From: "Joseph Stacy <+14157992242>" <sip:10000@pbx.example.net>
Authorization: Digest username="10000", realm="asterisk", ...
Asterisk Response:

SIP/2.0 404 Not Found
WARNING[xxxxx]: res_pjsip_registrar.c:1239 find_registrar_aor:
  AOR '' not found for endpoint '10000' (203.0.113.88:59759)
üîç Diagnosis
CLI Tools Used

pjsip show endpoint 10000
pjsip show aors
pjsip show auths
pjsip show identifies
pjsip set logger on
Observations
Authentication succeeded (200 OK after digest).

But Asterisk couldn't match to any AOR ‚Üí 404 returned.

The [aor] section had a different name than the aors= entry in [endpoint].

Also, a lingering contact_user=10000 in [global] was ignored by PJSIP and may have confused expectations.

üß¨ What We Learned
Asterisk doesn‚Äôt throw obvious errors when aors= references an undefined [aor] section.

PJSIP silently fails registration if aor can't be resolved ‚Äî even after successful auth.

The contact_user global setting is deprecated or irrelevant under PJSIP.

pjsip reload isn‚Äôt always enough; core reload or even a full restart may be needed to flush stale object state.

NAT traversal requires rtp_symmetric, rewrite_contact, and force_rport.
